Lock-Free Event Bus - Partition Scaling Benchmark
==================================================

System: Apple M1, 8C/8T, 16GB RAM, macOS 13.2.1
Compiler: Apple clang version 14.0.3 (clang-1403.0.22.14.1)
Build: Release (-O3)

=== SUMMARY ===

Workload: 10,000 events with simulated processing work (~1ms per event)
Maximum Scaling: 4.5x throughput improvement compared to single partition single consumer setup
Optimal Configuration: 8 partitions (matches CPU cores)
Message Reliability: 100% delivery (10000/10000 events in all tests) / Used BLOCKING Backpressure strategy as consumers  were busy doing simulated work
Perfect Load Distribution: Events distributed evenly across all consumers

Key Findings:
- Near-linear scaling up to CPU core count (8 cores)
- 4 partitions: 3.6x improvement
- 8 partitions: 4.5x improvement
- 15 partitions: No additional benefit (4.5x - thread contention limit)
- Producer overhead remains minimal (2-5ms across all configurations)

=== THROUGHPUT ANALYSIS ===

Configuration    | Throughput | Scaling Factor | Efficiency
----------------|------------|----------------|------------
1 Partition     | 1,159/sec  | 1.0x (baseline)| 100%
4 Partitions    | 4,211/sec  | 3.6x          | 90%
8 Partitions    | 5,230/sec  | 4.5x          | 56%*
15 Partitions   | 5,269/sec  | 4.5x          | 30%*

*Efficiency = (Scaling Factor / Partition Count) Ã— 100%, this shows how much we are gaining by adding additional partition and consumer

=== DETAILED RESULTS ===

Baseline: Single Partition
--------------------------
Configuration: 1 partition, 1 consumer
Producer: 10,000 events published in 2ms
Consumer Load: 10,000 events processed by single consumer
Processing Time: 8,627ms
Throughput: 1,159 msg/sec

Scaled: 4 Partitions
---------------------
Configuration: 4 partitions, 4 consumers
Producer: 10,000 events published in 5ms
Consumer Load Distribution:
  - Consumer 0: 2,500 events
  - Consumer 1: 2,500 events
  - Consumer 2: 2,500 events
  - Consumer 3: 2,500 events
Processing Time: 2,375ms
Throughput: 4,211 msg/sec
Improvement: 3.6x over baseline

Scaled: 8 Partitions (Optimal)
------------------------------
Configuration: 8 partitions, 8 consumers
Producer: 10,000 events published in 5ms
Consumer Load Distribution:
  - Consumers 0-7: 1,250 events each (perfect distribution)
Processing Time: 1,912ms
Throughput: 5,230 msg/sec
Improvement: 4.5x over baseline

Scaled: 15 Partitions (Over-provisioned)
---------------------------------------
Configuration: 15 partitions, 15 consumers
Producer: 10,000 events published in 5ms
Consumer Load Distribution:
  - Consumers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9: 667 events each
  - Consumers 10,11,12,13,14: 666 events each
Processing Time: 1,898ms
Throughput: 5,269 msg/sec
Improvement: 4.5x over baseline (no gain vs 8 partitions)

=== ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS ===

Optimal Partition Count: 8 (matches CPU core count)
- Perfect utilization of available CPU cores

Diminishing Returns: Beyond 8 partitions
- Thread context switching overhead increases
- No additional CPU resources to utilize

Producer Performance:
- Round-robin distribution works efficiently
- No bottleneck at message ingestion layer

=== PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS ===

- Use 4-8 partitions for CPU-bound workloads on 8-core systems
- Single partition sufficient for I/O-bound or low-volume scenarios
- Monitor consumer processing time to determine optimal partition count
- Over-partitioning provides no benefit and adds complexity
