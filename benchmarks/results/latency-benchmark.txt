=== PERFORMANCE INSIGHTS ===

Queue Depth Impact:
- Burst scenarios show clear queue depth effects on latency
- Multi-partition reduces per-queue depth from 15K to 3.75K events
- 4x reduction in queue depth yields 2x latency improvement

Load Distribution:
- Perfect event distribution across all partitions/consumers
- Zero message loss in all test scenarios
- Parallel processing eliminates single-consumer bottlenecks

Coordination Overhead:
- Minimal impact on sustained workloads (7μs P50 difference)
- Thread-safe latency collection adds negligible overhead
- Multi-consumer coordination does not degrade performance

=== ARCHITECTURAL RECOMMENDATIONS ===

Use Single Partition (1P/1C) when:
- Sustained load < 5K events/sec
- Strict message ordering required
- Minimal resource usage preferred
- Latency requirements > 100μs acceptable

Use Multi Partition (4P/4C) when:
- Burst workloads exceed consumer capacity
- Sub-millisecond P99 latency require
- CPU cores available for parallel processing
